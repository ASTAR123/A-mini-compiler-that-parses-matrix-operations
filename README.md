# Introduction
Build a mini compiler, perform many matrix calculations, and configure Lex and Yacc.

# Run
Lex and Yacc can be installed on Linux, MacOS, and Windows. Here, we are implementing them in a Windows Operating System. To compile and run Lex and Yacc programs on Windows, follow these steps:
